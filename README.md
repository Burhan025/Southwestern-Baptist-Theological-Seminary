In this project, I have enhanced event carousels with dynamic "View Event" buttons, added location-based filters, and optimized display logic. Built a jQuery-powered tuition calculator for dynamic tuition and cost calculations, implemented AJAX filtering for job listings, created dynamic course and scholarship templates with interactive features.
